# Sales-Insights
Conducted an in-depth analysis of sales data for an IT company, focusing on identifying key trends, performance metrics, and opportunities for revenue growth. The report provided a comprehensive overview of sales activities, customer segmentation, and product performance, enabling data-driven decision-making for the sales and marketing teams. 
 Question Sets-   
➢ Total revenue generated?   
➢ Total sales quantity?  
➢ Revenue generated by the markets?  
➢ Sales quantity by the markets?  
➢ Revenue achieved by the month?  
➢ Top-10 customer by revenue?  
• In MySQL workbench I had used to find the 
insights by applying various types of joins on 
different tables.  
• Created a new measure to find the revenue 
generated in power BI with the help of DAX.   
Revenue = SUM('sales transactions'[sales_amount])   
• Created a new measure of sales quantity in 
power BI by DAX.  
Sales Quantity = SUM('sales transactions'[sales_qty])
